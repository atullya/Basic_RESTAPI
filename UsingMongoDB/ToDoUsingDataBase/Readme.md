Project: To-Do Application
1. Overview
Description: A simple To-Do application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The app leverages a RESTful API for task management, ensuring data persistence across sessions and a smooth user experience.

Purpose: This project demonstrates my ability to implement CRUD operations through a RESTful API, as well as my understanding of integrating front-end and back-end technologies.

2. Features
Add Tasks: Users can input up to 4 tasks, which are then stored in the database.
View Tasks: Users can view all existing tasks, including their names and status (completed or pending).
Update Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed or edit task details directly through the UI.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks only when they are marked as completed, ensuring that accidental deletions are avoided.
Improved UI: A more user-friendly interface with a clean design, making task management more intuitive.
3. Technology Stack
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
Back-end: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB (or any other suitable database for data storage)
4. API Endpoints
GET /api/todos: Retrieve all tasks.
POST /api/todos: Create a new task.
PATCH /api/todos/:id: Update an existing task (e.g., mark as completed).
DELETE /api/todos/:id: Delete a task by its ID (only if the task is marked as completed).
5. Implementation Steps
Set up the Backend: Created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to handle requests and manage tasks in the database.
Connect the Frontend: Used Axios or Fetch API to interact with the backend endpoints, implementing functionality to display and manage tasks.
User Interface: Designed a clean, responsive UI that allows users to easily add, view, update, and delete tasks, improving user experience.
6. Challenges Faced
Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to manage API response errors and ensure users receive appropriate feedback.
State Management: Managed state effectively in React to reflect real-time updates without page refreshes, ensuring a seamless user experience.
7. Future Improvements
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks.
Task Prioritization: Add features for prioritizing tasks and setting due dates, helping users to manage their time better.
Mobile Responsiveness: Enhance the UI for better usability on mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience on all screen sizes.
8. Conclusion
The To-Do application showcases my ability to build full-stack applications using RESTful APIs. It not only demonstrates my technical skills but also highlights my understanding of user-centered design principles and how to create a feature-rich yet simple task management tool.
